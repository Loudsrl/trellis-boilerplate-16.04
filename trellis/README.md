## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [https://roots.io/trellis/docs/](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/).

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) >= 4.3.10
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) >= 2.0.1

## Installation

The recommended directory structure for a Trellis project looks like:

```shell
example.com/      # → Root folder for the project
├── trellis/      # → Your clone of this repository
└── site/         # → A Bedrock-based WordPress site
    └── web/
        ├── app/  # → WordPress content directory (themes, plugins, etc.)
        └── wp/   # → WordPress core (don't touch!)
```

See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

1. Create a new project directory: `$ mkdir example.com && cd example.com`
2. Clone Trellis: `$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/trellis.git && rm -rf trellis/.git`
3. Clone Bedrock: `$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/bedrock.git site && rm -rf site/.git`

Windows user? [Read the Windows docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/windows/) for slightly different installation instructions. VirtualBox is known to have poor performance in Windows — use VMware or [see some possible solutions](https://discourse.roots.io/t/virtualbox-performance-in-windows/3932).

## Local development setup

1. Configure your WordPress sites in `group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml` and in `group_vars/development/vault.yml`
2. Ensure you're in the trellis directory: `cd trellis`
3. Run `vagrant up`

[Read the local development docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/local-development-setup/) for more information.

## Remote server setup (staging/production)

For remote servers, installing Ansible locally is an additional requirement. See the [docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/remote-server-setup/#requirements) for more information.

A base Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) server is required for setting up remote servers. OS X users must have [passlib](http://pythonhosted.org/passlib/install.html#installation-instructions) installed.

Note: Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) is still supported as well. See [#992](https://github.com/roots/trellis/pull/992) for details on the minor changes needed to run it.

1. Configure your WordPress sites in `group_vars/<environment>/wordpress_sites.yml` and in `group_vars/<environment>/vault.yml` (see the [Vault docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/) for how to encrypt files containing passwords)
2. Add your server IP/hostnames to `hosts/<environment>`
3. Specify public SSH keys for `users` in `group_vars/all/users.yml` (see the [SSH Keys docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/ssh-keys/))
4. Run `ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=<environment>` to provision the server

[Read the remote server docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/remote-server-setup/) for more information.

## Deploying to remote servers

1. Add the `repo` (Git URL) of your Bedrock WordPress project in the corresponding `group_vars/<environment>/wordpress_sites.yml` file
2. Set the `branch` you want to deploy
3. Run `./bin/deploy.sh <environment> <site name>`
4. To rollback a deploy, run `ansible-playbook rollback.yml -e "site=<site name> env=<environment>"`

[Read the deploys docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/deploys/) for more information.
